\section{Background and Recent Research}

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
It was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel
development; it has since been adopted by many other projects.

JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language originally
implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact
with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the
document content that was displayed. It is prototype-based, dynamic, weakly
typed, and has first-class functions. Its syntax was influenced by the language
C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two
languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key
design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme
programming languages. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting
object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

Git's primary user interface is the command line shell and it is really good in
its own way. There are alternate user interfaces for git, like
magit\cite{magit}, an interface heavily optimized for Emacs\cite{emacs} users.
Alternate interfaces expand the features of git core to new dimensions.

\textbf{This project aims to build an alternate interface to Git, which can be
  used from JavaScript.}
