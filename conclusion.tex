\chapter{Conclusion}

This project helped to gain a insight into the git, v8 and node ecosystems. All
efforts will be put into stabilizing and completing all the necessary features
so that the library is good enough to write 3rd party applications. Even though
the project load was underestimated, most of it could be finished on time and
the project is in a usable state now. The research on this project was really a
good learning experience and will be continued even after the project duration.

In the next iteration of the project will try to stabilize and test the
asynchronous API properly. Tests and documentation will be improved. All efforts
will be given to package the application as a npm library for 1 line
installation. Testing the system to measure its performance in real world
scenarios will be done if time permits. There are certain features that will
make the library standout uniquely and priority will be given to add those, like
history visualization etc. A GUI application using the library is also planned
and will start working on that soon after the major milestones are complete.
