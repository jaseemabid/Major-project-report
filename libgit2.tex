\section{libgit2}

\textit{Libgit2}\cite{libgit2} is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git
core methods provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API,
allowing you to write native speed custom Git applications in any language which
supports C bindings.

Libgit2 adds an abstraction layer over git and removes the need to resort to the
plumbing commands and gives the application developers a C API to build their
applications on. This is a huge leap over plumbing commands because it makes the
code a lot simpler and reduces error rate by a huge factor. JavaScript as such
wont allow native C bindings and this is where we use node.js and v8.

\texttt{Libnodegit} is a port of libgit2 to the node.js platform and hence the
name. Similar projects are bindings for other languages, like
rugged\cite{rugged} for Ruby, luagit2\cite{luagit2} for Lua and
pygit2\cite{pygit2} for Python among the few.
