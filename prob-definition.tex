Design and implement a JavaScript library called \textit{Libnodegit} to work
with git repositories, using node.js and libgit2. \\ \\

Libnodegit aims to be an object oriented abstraction over git repositories and
expose a new rich API by hiding the unnecessary low level features. It tries to
bridge the gap between Git and JavaScript allowing JavaScript to access and
modify git repositories easily.
