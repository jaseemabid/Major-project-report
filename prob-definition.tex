Design and implement a JavaScript library called
\textit{\textbf{libnodegit}} to work
with git repositories, using node.js and libgit2. \\

Libnodegit aims to be an object oriented abstraction over git
repositories and expose a new rich API by hiding the unnecessary low
level features. It tries to bridge the gap between Git and JavaScript
allowing JavaScript to access and modify git repositories easily.
