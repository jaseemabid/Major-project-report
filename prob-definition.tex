Design and implement a JavaScript library called \textit{Libnodegit} to work
with git repositories, using node.js and libgit2.

Libnodegit aims to be an object oriented abstraction over git repositories and
expose a new rich API by hiding the unnecessary low level features. It will make
accessing and modifying git repositories much easier. This is already a standard
way of exposing APIs to databases, filesystems etc in a higher level languages.
