\chapter{Work Done}

The core that is required to build usable applications is complete and the
library is already in a usable condition. It can already read most of the
repository properties and applications can be scripted in JavaScript to work
with the log, index properties etc. The examples folder in the source contains
reference implementations of few standard git commands, like \texttt{git log
  --oneline -10}.

The project is very modular, and new features can be added relatively easily
now.

The magnitude of the project was underestimated while the milestones were
decided, but a good portion of that could be completed on time. The project
required exceptionally good C++ knowledge and required a lot more time than what
was anticipated.

\section{Progress made in previous semester}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Conducted preliminary research and feasibility study on the subject
	\item Clear project goals were defined
	\item Familiarized with git, learned about the internals and plumbing
    \item Familiarized with libgit2, and its low level C API and how it maps to
      git commands.
    \item Learned extensively about V8 and C++
    \item Designed the JavaScript API
    \item Decided the test suite and wrote initial tests for the API
    \item Got the initial version of the code ready, which could read basic
      repository properties.
    \item Made the design modular so that new features can be added relatively
      easily.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Active status}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ability to work with the index
    \item Read the history and logs
    \item History walking, branching, some visualizations
    \item Read arbitrary commits/blobs/notes/branches
    \item Wrote extensive tests for finished features
    \item Initial work to package the library for simple installation
\end{enumerate}

\section{Milestones could not be completed}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item File and diff viewing
    \item Read and write repository configurations and settings
    \item Modify history - Write new commits, rebase etc
    \item Network \& initialization features
    \item Asynchronous API
\end{enumerate}
