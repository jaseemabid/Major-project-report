\chapter{Work Done}

The core that is required to build usable applications over libnodegit can be
developed in time and the project is already in a usable condition. The library
can already read most of the repository properties and applications can be
scripted in JavaScript to work with the log, index properties etc. The examples
folder in the source contains reference implementations of few standard git
commands, like \texttt{git log --oneline -10}.

The magnitude of the project was underestimated while the milestones were
decided, but a good portion of that can be completed on time. The project
required exceptionally good C++ knowledge and required a lot more time than what
was anticipated.

\section{Progress made in previous semester}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Clear project goals were defined.
\item Familiarized with git, libgit2 and node.js API and design principles.
\item Designed the JavaScript API
\item Started writing actual code
\item Read repository properties/status

\end{enumerate}

\section{Active status}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Ability to work with the git index
    \item Read the history/logs
    \item History walking, branching
    \item Read arbitrary commits/blobs/notes/branches

\end{enumerate}


\section{Expectations by the end of the semester}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Read and write repository configurations and settings
    \item File and diff viewing
    \item Simple Asynchronous API for demonstration

\end{enumerate}




\section{Milestones that  might be missed}


\begin{enumerate}

	\item Modify/Update history - Write new commits, rebase etc
    \item Network \& initialization features

\end{enumerate}

\section{Future work}

The research on this project was really fruitfull and will be

There are certain features that will make the library standout and unique.
