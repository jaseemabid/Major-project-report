\section{Git}

Git is fundamentally a content addressable filesystem with a VCS user
interface written on top of it. It is a simple key value data store
were you can insert any kind of content into it, and it will give you
back a key - a SHA1 id that you can use to retrieve the content again
at any time.

Gitâ€™s design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone\cite{inspiration}.
It was originally designed as a low-level version control system
engine on top of which others could write front ends. However, the
core project has since become a complete revision control system that
is usable directly. More of this will be discussed later.
